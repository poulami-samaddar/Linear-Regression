# Linear-Regression

## Linear regression projects

This section includes two linear regression projects completed during Udemy course (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Boot camp) taught by Jose Portilla. 

## Project 1: Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

A model is trained which can predict the price of a house when some featured are provided.

###### Features: 
* Avg. Area Income
* Avg. Area House Age
* Avg. Area Number of Rooms
* Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms 
* Area Population 
* Price
* Address
  
## Project 2: Analyze the customer data of an Ecommerce company using Linear Regression

The customers data of an Ecommerce company is provided. With the help of this data the trained model should predict if their mobile app experience or website is more useful for the customer. 

###### Features: 	
* Email
* Address
* Avatar
* Avg. Session Length
* Time on App
* Time on Website
* Length of Membership
* Yearly Amount Spent.
    
 After training it is found that length of membership is a very important feature as it is greatly associated with amount spent. 
 One would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion.
